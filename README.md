# website-template
The Odin Project - Website template project
This is LLuvia's first complete website layout.

The responsive version is what I did first because I missed where it said not to make it responsive. After I finished most  of that version I ran into some problems, reread the instructions and started over from scratch. I think the index.html is much cleaner, the responsive version is much more messy.
